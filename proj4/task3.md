# Project 4 Task 3

# Cloth resting on sphere (with different `ks` settings)

As we increase the spring constant value, the cloth gets stiffer (see the writeup of Part 1 for more details).

The cloth cannot "bend to the shape" of the sphere (and also be as affected by the force of gravity) at higher `ks` settings, so the cloth doesn't “drape down” as much.

The cloth, resting on the sphere, with `ks = 5000`. Notice how the cloth is “draping down” a lot.

The cloth has collided with the plane and is now resting on the plane.
