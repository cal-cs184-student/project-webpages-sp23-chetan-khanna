# Task 3

## How this works

We use linear algebra to apply transformations to images, including `rotate`, `scale`, and `translate`.

In order to be able to use matrices for (affine) transformations, we use homogeneous coordinates, which involves appending an extra *row* to the bottom of the matrix and setting (in this situation) the bottommost element of the last column vector to 1. Using matrices helps speed up calculations.

# Demonstration

The following shows a picture of cubeman powerlifting so much that his arms have turned blue. He’s an avid gym-goer so his lower legs are also *very* muscly.

He “went too hard” and needs to go to the ER, but thanks to the sad state of American healthcare, he can't afford to go.
